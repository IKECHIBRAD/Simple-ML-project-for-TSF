# Simple regression Model

The model was built using Python and popular data science libraries such as pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn. The main objective is to use a simple regression approach to understand the relationship between study hours and scores. The project demonstrates the following steps:

Data exploration and visualization.
Data preprocessing.
Building and training the linear regression model.
Model evaluation and predictions.
Visualization of the regression line and predictions.
